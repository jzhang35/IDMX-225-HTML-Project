                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p>I was born in Kearny, New Jersey. When I was 2 years old, my family and I moved to Hillsborough, New Jersey, which is where my family has lived ever since. For most of my life, I was a student in the Hillsborough public school district. I graduated from Rutgers University.</p>

                <p>One of the things I enjoy doing is playing smash ultimate with people. I also enjoy improving my fluency in speaking Shanghainese, which is a Chinese dialect my family and I speak. I also enjoy practicing Mandarin on Duolingo every day because, even though I speak the dialect, I don’t read and write as well as I speak, which is what I’m currently trying to improve on in Duolingo. I also enjoy practicing French on Duolingo every day. Sometimes, I also enjoy playing the piano. Usually, I look up the sheet music for songs and tunes that I like on musescore.com. Then, I self-learn the sheet music. There are also times I enjoy playing chess on chess.com. Last, but not least, I enjoy playing sports, such as ping-pong, basketball, tennis, and frisbee.</p>

                <p>Some interesting facts about me are that I've also never had to shave. I have an older brother who’s never had to shave either. Furthermore, I'm trilingual, speaking English, Mandarin, and Shanghainese. As mentioned already, I’m also currently trying to improve my French by practicing on Duolingo every day. I have some foundation with French from high school and middle school, which is why I’m able to pick up the learning again.</p>

                <p>In the future, I want to be a software engineer. I studied mostly hardware as an undergrad at Rutgers, but I want to go in the software direction. After graduation, I got a position as a software engineer at a company called Revature. I was in a paid training for around two months until I got released along with several others because we did not meet the performance requirements. The first few weeks of the training were manageable, but quickly escalated after those few weeks. I also didn’t have that much background in software when I was in college, which is why I wasn’t able to meet the expectations. This is why I decided to start doing a programming certificate at RVCC, which I started doing this spring semester of 2023. This semester, I’m taking two courses, one being a Java course while the other being a Web Page Development course. With the program being only several courses, my strategy for deciding to do a programming certificate at RVCC is to try to gain a strong foundation in the field within a short amount of time in order to find a job in the software engineering field. In addition, this certificate program will also help a lot when I put it on my resume.</p>

                <h2>Background-Image Property</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element. By default, a
                    background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element. It is repeated both vertically and
                    horizontally. The element’s background is the total size of the element, which includes the padding
                    and the border, but not the margin.</p>

                <p>Background images are drawn by stacking context layers on top of each other. The borders of the
                    element are afterwards drawn on top of them. The background-color is drawn beneath them. The way the
                    images are drawn relative to the box and its borders is done by the background-clip and
                    background-origin CSS properties. If an image can’t be drawn, such as when a filed denoted by the
                    URI can’t be loaded, browsers would handle as they would handle a none value.</p>

                <p>The URI value indicates a location in which the image can be found. It also makes sure that no
                    background image will be displayed. This is also the default settings, meaning you won’t need to
                    define it unless you want override previous background-image declarations. The URI value causes for
                    the element to inherit the background-image of its parent element. This approach is not usually used
                    since the element’s inherited background-image would most likely overlap the parent element’s image.
                    Most of the time, the parent element’s background-image can be seen through its transparent
                    background unless another background-image or background-color has been set.</p>

                <p>Each background image is indicated either by the keyword “none” or as an image value. “none” is a
                    keyword, indicating the absence of images. The image value indicates for the image to display. In
                    order to specify multiple background images, supply multiple values, separated by a comma.</p>

                <p>In terms of browser support, there is a scaling for each browser in terms of how much each browser
                    supports the background-image property. Chrome is 1.0. Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are 4.0.
                    Mozilla Firefox is 1.0. Safari is 1.0. Opera is 3.5.</p>

                <p>The are some property values of background-image. The URL value is the URL to the image. To have more
                    than one image, you need to separate the URLs with a comma. The none value means that no background
                    image will be displayed, which is the default. The conic-gradient() value sets a conic gradient as
                    the background image and defines at least two colors. The linear-gradient() value sets a radial
                    gradient as the background image and defines at least two colors (center to edges). The
                    repeating-conic-gradient() value repeats a conic gradient. The repeating-linear-gradient() value
                    repeats a linear gradient. The repeating-radial-gradient() value repeats a radial gradient. The
                    repeating-radial-gradient() value repeats a radial gradient. The initial value sets the
                    background-image property to the initial default value. The inherit value inherits the
                    background-image property from its parents element.</p>

                <p>There’s also the matter of setting a fallback color. If a background image fails to load or if the
                    gradient background is opened on a browser that doesn’t support gradients, the browser will look for
                    a background color as a fallback.</p>

                <h2>CSS Animations</h2>
            </section>

            <div>
                <p>CSS allows animation of HTML elements without having to use JavaScript or Flash. CSS animations make elements transition from one style to another. In order to use CSS animations, you first need to indicate keyframes for the animation because keyframes contain the styles the element will have at specific times. There’s also an Animate.css library, which contains cross-browser animations for use in web projects, used for purposes like emphasis, home pages, sliders, and attention-guiding hints.</p>

                <p>People may ask what advantages CSS animations have over traditional script-driven animation methods. First of all, CSS animations are easy to use for simple animations and can be made without needing to know JavaScript. Second of all, CSS animations run well even in moderate system load, as simple animations often don’t perform very well with JavaScript. The engine can use frame-skipping and other methods to keep the performance smooth. Third of all, CSS animations cause for the browser to optimize performance and efficiency because the browser is in control of the animation sequence.</p>

                <p>When you indicate a CSS style inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually transition from the current style to the new style at a specific time. Furthermore, you must bind the animation to an element in order for the animation to work. In addition, the animation-duration property determines how long the animation takes to complete. If not specified, there will be no animation because the default value is 0s, which is 0 seconds. You can also determine the time duration of the animations using percentage. From this, you can add as many style changes as you like.</p>

                <p>The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation. Negative values are also allowed as the animation will start as though it had been playing for the positive value of that many seconds.</p>

                <p>The animation-iteration-count property indicates the number of times the animation runs. When you use the value “infinite”, the animation will run forever.</p>

                <p>The animation-direction property which indicates whether an animation is played forwards or backgrounds or in alternate cycles. “normal” is when the animation is played forward. “reverse” is when the animation is played in reverse. “alternate” is when the animation is first played forward, then backward. “alternate-reverse” is when the animation is first played backward, then forward.</p>

                <p>The animation-timing-function property indicates the speed curve of the animation. “ease” causes for the animation to start slow, then fast, then end slow again. “ease-in” causes for an animation to start slow. “ease-out” causes for an animation to end slow. “ease-in-out” causes for an animation to start slow and end slow. “cubic-bezier (n, n, n, n)” allows for you to define your own values in a cubic-bezier function.</p>
            
                <p>The animation-fill-mode property indicates a style for an element when the animation is not playing. “none” is the default value, indicating for the animation to not apply any style to an element before or after it is executing. “forwards” causes for an element to keep its style values set by the previous keyframe. “backwards” causes for an element to inherit the style values set by the first keyframe and keep this during the animation-delay period. “both” causes for the animation to follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, making the animation properties apply in both directions.</p>
