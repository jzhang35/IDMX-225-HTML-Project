## Description

For the very top part of the page that's a black strip, I learned how to make a nav bar, which are buttons that bring me to specific parts of the page when I click on them. I also learned how to insert a logo onto my website.

For next part of the page that has a picture of me and information about me, I learned how to adjust the size and color of my margin, border, padding, and content. I also learned how to create an avatar and insert it onto my website.

For the next part that's my biography and my hobbies, I learned how to making headings, bullet points, and how to adjust the positioning of my content.

For the next part that's has a table of my photos, I learned how to make a table to contain photos along with labels.

For photos, I learned how to adjust the visual quality of them. For the next part with the blog, I learned how to use "lit p:first-child:first-letter" to reformat the visual look of the first letter of my blog.

For the next "I like" and song lyrics section, similar to the biography and hobbies section, I learned how to make headings and make bullet points. In addition, I learned how to insert a photo from another websie.

For the clickable link below, I learned how to link a website to a group of text and allow the user to click on the text to access the website.

For the next part, I learned how to insert a video from Youtube into my website. I also learned how to size, shape, and change the color of the border that goes around the video.

For the next part, I learned how to make a form that can take input data from a user and then store it.

For the final part, similar to the second part of my website, I learned how to adjust the size and color of my margin, border, padding, and content. I also learned how to use the "&copy;" symbol.


## Color Scheme

For the background color of my entire page, I have #AB921A as the color. For the background color of my personal info section at the top, I have #537309 as the color. For it's border, I have #00F2D2 as the color. For the text inside, I have #24E040 as the color. This is also the same color scheme for my padding, border, and text at the very bottom of the page. Most of the text on my page is the color #0064DB. However, in the hobbies section, there are a few lines that are the color brown and #24E040.
